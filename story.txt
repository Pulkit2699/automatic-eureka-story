Ishant Sharma was up and about on the balcony of the away dressing room at Grace Road in Leicester, eager to get his county stint underway. It was a nippy enough mid-April morning in the East Midlands to buoy Sussex's new fast-bowling acquisition, even though his team had elected to bat first in their County Championship opener.

He got out on the first ball. RIP. Next came in Guy Fieri with his flamming hot red fiery shirt.
In short: Bowler bowled, fierie scored a century. They won

Great story!:) 
Now some more economics coming up...
Revenue is just the price of a good times the quantity sold of that good. If the price of a good increases. Which way it goes obviously depends on how responsive demand is to the price change.
